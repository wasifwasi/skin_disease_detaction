# Skin Disease Detection

This project is a skin disease detection model trained using the EfficientNetB3 architecture. The model achieves **84% accuracy** after training for **7 epochs**.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is available on Kaggle:
[Skin Diseases Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailpromus/skin-diseases-image-dataset)

## Features
- Uses **EfficientNetB3** for image classification.
- Trained on a diverse dataset of skin disease images.
- Achieves **84% accuracy** in detecting skin diseases.

## Usage
- Users can upload images of skin conditions.
- The model predicts the possible disease.
- Recommendations for doctors based on the results.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin_disease_detection.git
   cd skin_disease_detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
